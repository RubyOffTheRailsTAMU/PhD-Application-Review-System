Summary:
  The main purpose of our application is to streamline the PhD application review process. This process includes adding candidate information, allowing faculty to review the applications, and then to generate a report compiled of all reviews. More specifically, once a candidate is in the system, a committee chair will do a inital review and create a committee of faculty assigned to review the application. The reviews will constitute a text review and a numeric score from 1-5. 
  In addtion to the main process the system is designed to aid, other features to improve user experience will be added. Theses includ: a search page that will allow a faculty member to find all candidates that meet a specified criteria, a user friendly home page that will display unreviewed assigned candidated for a faculty to review at a high priority, and a candidate add page that will take a csv file (or other format... to be determined) and add the candidate to the system.
